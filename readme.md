# Setup

## Disk drives

Unless you want to use leaderboards, you only need to have 1 disk drive installed.

All util scripts in here, assume all the utilities are installed within `disk/`

### Steps

1. Install `disk_drive` into the computer network, and plug in a floppy.
2. Drag and drop all files in `utils` into `disk/`
3. Done!

## Disk emulation

If you do not want to have to use a disk for debug, or final setup, you can also "emulate" a disk drive.

### Steps

1. Make a directory called `disk` in the root computer directory
2. Drag and drop all files in `utils` into `disk/`
3. Done!
